# Reverse an Array

- Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency

- We used (len) to read the length of the list to figure out which items of the list are we swapping.
- We then used the for in loop to swap the items (first item swapped with last, second item swapped with second to last etc...)
- After we went thrught and did that, we then printed num which was the reversed listed we started with.
